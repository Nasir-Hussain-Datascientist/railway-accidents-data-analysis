This approach simplifies the analysis while providing clear insights into the impact of different seasons on the number of accidents\n",

Raising this figure to the power of goods train indicates that each additional goods train entails expenditure equivalent to about 36.

However, the coefficient of goods trains is insignificant implication that the effect of the goods trains on the number of accidents is less conclusive.\r\n",

By examining the model sum of squares value and comparing it to the residual sum of squares, one can say that the model bears a fair level of fit with data, which implies that the former accounts for a significant part of the variation in the numbers of the accidents."

    "Number of Casualties Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The GLM analysis for predicting the number of casualties reveals an intercept of 0.3582. This suggests that when there are no accidents, the expected number of casualties is roughly zero, although this is not statistically significant. The coefficient for the number of accidents is 0.1655, indicating that each additional accident is associated with approximately a 16.55% increase in the number of casualties. However, this relationship is not statistically significant, as indicated by the p-value of 0.169. The Pseudo R-squared value of 0.2723 suggests a moderate level of fit, meaning that the model explains a portion of the variability in the number of casualties based on the number of accidents.\n",

    "Number of Deaths Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For the number of deaths, the intercept is -1.0771, which is not statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.316. The coefficient for the number of accidents is 0.2944, suggesting a 29.44% increase in the number of deaths for each additional accident. This coefficient has a p-value of 0.109, which implies that while the effect is positive, it is not statistically significant at conventional levels. The Pseudo R-squared value of 0.3686 indicates that this model has a somewhat better fit compared to the casualties model, explaining more of the variability in the number of deaths based on the number of accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Injuries Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model for predicting the number of injuries, the intercept is 1.2700, which is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.009, suggesting a baseline level of injuries. The coefficient for the number of accidents is 0.0733, indicating a smaller increase of about 7.33% in the number of injuries for each additional accident. This effect is not statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.442. The Pseudo R-squared value of 0.09346 shows that this model explains only a small proportion of the variance in the number of injuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined analysis shows that while there is a positive association between the number of accidents and each type of severity (casualties, deaths, and injuries), the strength and significance of these relationships vary. The models indicate that the number of accidents does have some impact on casualties, deaths, and injuries, but the effects are not consistently strong or statistically significant. This suggests that additional factors or more complex interactions might be influencing these outcomes, and further exploration is needed to improve the models and understand the full scope of factors affecting railway accident severity."
