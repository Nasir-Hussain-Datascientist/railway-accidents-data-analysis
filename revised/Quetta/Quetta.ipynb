    "Thus, we have used a model in the qualitative research method in which we have analyzed railway accidents of the Quetta region to determine the causes that lead to number of accidents. The model considered three main factors: there have been cases of derailments, collisions, and collisions at level crossings.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Derailments\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When coming to the results, one can note that the cases of derailments affect the size of the number of accidents. Namely, each new type of derailment is associated with a roughly 15% increase in the number of accidents. From this one could infer that derailments are a significant cause of the occurrence of accidents in the city of Quetta because tackling this problem could lead to the minimization of overall accidents.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Collisions\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Looking at the interaction with collisions, it is possible to note that the amount of collisions reveals a 16% raise for every additional collision. However, this effect is not significant in our setting meaning while collision does appear to influence a higher number of accident it is not a potent factor compared to derailment.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Collisions at Level Crossings\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Level crossing accidents also record a surge in the number of accidents, whereby each collision is likely to cause a thirteen percent increase in accidents. However, similar to collisions, this factor is, therefore, not identified as having significant risk by significance analysis in this study, which implies that its impact is comparatively small than those of derailments.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Model Fit\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The model fits slightly more than 60% of the variation in the numbers of accidents, which is a good fit. This implies that the factors that we captured (especially the derailments) are fairly valid in regards to the assessment of accident rate and possibly trends in the Quetta area.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Summary\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Concisely, it could be estimated that the derailments are the most frequent type of the railway accidents in Quetta. However, collisions, level crossing accidents also contribute; but they appear not to be as compelling. It might be necessary to emphasize the efforts aimed at decreasing the number of derailments for increasing the railway safety in the area."

Unfortunately, this effect is not even close to being statistically different form zero as its p-value equals 0. 079, meaning while the relation exists it is not strong enough for the statistical testing of our data at this point.

This implies that though the nature of a line whether a Main Line or Branch Line can partly explain the number of accidents, other variables not in the model also contribute to the number of accHeavier traffic on the Main Line is also evident from the analysis to mean that the number of accidents on the line is higher as opposed to the Branch Line with the estimation of an additional approximately 52. 6%.

Seventy five accidents on the Branch Line. However, the result for the Main Line is the non-significant result and so one has to be extra careful while using this result.

    "Based on the findings of the analysis, it can be appreciated that the frequency of accidents depends on the season. The total incidents in SPRING are also slightly less than in WINTER by about 4. 57%. On the other hand, the number of accidents that occurred in Summer is comparatively high and to be precise it is approximately 46 extra. 4%. Thus, Winter is used as a reference point, and the average for this season is equal to 8. 77 accidents. This seasonal fluctuation clearly means that some months of the year in particular summer are tragic for railway transport safety in the Quetta area. If possible, more study on the specific factors that make Summer to have the highest accident rate could help in the enhancement of railway safety during this season."

    "The coefficient for causes of damage to PR is -0.0381. This suggests that, on the log scale, the cost of damage decreases by 0.0381 for each unit increase in the causes of damage to PR. When exponentiated (exp(-0.0381) ≈ 0.963), it indicates that an increase in the causes of damage to PR is associated with a 3.7% decrease in the cost of damage. The standard error is 0.0000721, and the z-value is -528.790, leading to a p-value of 0.000. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, this result is statistically significant, indicating a meaningful relationship between the causes of damage to PR and the cost of damage.\n",

    "The model's log-likelihood is -6.6691e+06, and the deviance is 1.3338e+07, indicating a good fit. The Pearson chi-squared value is 1.17e+07, and the Pseudo R-squared (CS) is 1.000, suggesting that the model explains the variance in the cost of damage almost perfectly.\n",

    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis indicates significant negative relationships between the number of accidents, the number of damages to PR, and the causes of damage to PR with the cost of damage. Specifically, increases in these factors are associated with decreases in the cost of damage. These insights highlight the complex nature of the factors influencing the cost of damage in railway accidents and can inform targeted strategies to mitigate these costs effectively.==================area.\r\n",
